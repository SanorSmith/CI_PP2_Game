            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell of the grid. The objective is to form a line of three of your symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
            <p>Here are the basic rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Player X starts the game.</li>
                <li>Players take turns to make their move by clicking on an empty cell.</li>
                <li>The game ends when one player forms a line of three symbols or when all cells are filled.</li>
                <li>If all cells are filled, the game is a draw.</li>
                <li>The player who forms a line of three symbols first wins the game.</li>
                <li>You can reset the board at any time by clicking the "<strong>Reset Board</strong> " button.</li>
                <li>You have the option to conclude the game by selecting "<strong>Restart Game</strong>" at any point.</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="game-history"  style="display: none;" class="border border mt-3 p-3">
            <h2>The history of the game</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Early Origins</strong>: The earliest known version of tic-tac-toe dates back to ancient Egypt, around 1300 B.C. Game boards from that era have been discovered on roofing tiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Roman Empire</strong>: The game was also popular in the Roman Empire, known as "Terni Lapilli". The Romans played a version of tic-tac-toe on three-by-three grids without needing to use a separate piece. Players would simply scratch their marks (circles and lines) into the ground or on a board.</li>
                <li><strong>Middle Ages</strong>: In the Middle Ages, the game evolved into a teaching tool for concepts of strategy and spatial reasoning. It was used in Europe to teach children mathematics and strategy skills.</li>
                <li><strong>19th Century</strong>: The game, as it is known today, became popular in the United Kingdom in the 19th century. It was called "noughts and crosses" at that time.</li>
                <li><strong>20th Century and Beyond</strong>: In the 20th century, tic-tac-toe became a staple of children's games in many countries. Its simplicity and quick gameplay made it a popular pastime. The game was also used in the early days of computer science to demonstrate artificial intelligence; in the 1950s, a computer that played tic-tac-toe was one of the first gaming computers called OXO or Noughts and Crosses.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Impact</strong>: Tic-tac-toe has been used in various educational and training settings. It's often one of the first games children learn, and it can teach important skills like turn-taking, strategy, and pattern recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Modern Times</strong>: Today, tic-tac-toe remains a popular game for all ages. It's used in various digital forms, from simple computer versions to more complex variations in video games and mobile apps. The game also continues to be a symbol in popular culture, often representing simplicity and the basic level of strategy.</li>
